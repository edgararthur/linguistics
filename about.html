            <h3>Mission</h3>
            <p>
                The Linguistics Association of Ghana aims to advance scholarship concerning the role of language in society as it relates to group and individual behaviour. The purposes of LAG are: <br> (1) to provide an international forum to foster the growth and development of scholarly research in the area of language and social psychology; <br>(2) to provide opportunities for our members to meet regularly in order to share and develop socially significant research;
                <br>(3) to promote scholarship that addresses pressing issues of our time as well as historically rooted social issues; and 
                <br>(4) to facilitate opportunities to publish, present, and promote language and social psychology research.

            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>
                The Association, which comprises researchers and scholars in tertiary institutions interested in the scientific study of languages, started as the "Linguistics Circle of Accra" in 1963. It became dormant in the 1990s. However, in 2006, it was revived, and it adopted the new name: The Linguistics Association of Ghana (LAG).
